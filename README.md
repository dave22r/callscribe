### Live transcription (ElevenLabs)

To use **live transcription** (mic → real-time transcript in the dashboard):

1. Get an API key from [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys) and create a `.env` file (see `.env.example`):
   ```bash
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
2. Start the token server (so the API key stays server-side):
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```
   Leave it running in a separate terminal (default: http://localhost:3001).
3. Start the app: `npm run dev`.
4. In the app, click **Start live transcription** in the Live Transcript panel and allow microphone access. Speak to see the transcript update in real time.

To run both frontend and token server in one go: `npm run dev:all`.

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.
